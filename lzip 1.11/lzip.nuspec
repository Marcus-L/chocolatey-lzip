    <summary>Lzip is a lossless data compressor with a user interface similar to the one of gzip or bzip2</summary>
    <description>Lzip can compress about as fast as gzip (lzip -0), or compress most files more than bzip2 (lzip -9). Decompression speed is intermediate between gzip and bzip2. Lzip is better than gzip and bzip2 from a data recovery perspective.

The lzip file format is designed for data sharing and long-term archiving, taking into account both data integrity and decoder availability:

* The lzip format provides very safe integrity checking and some data recovery means. The lziprecover program can repair bit-flip errors (one of the most common forms of data corruption) in lzip files, and provides data recovery capabilities, including error-checked merging of damaged copies of a file.
* The lzip format is as simple as possible (but not simpler). The lzip manual provides the source code of a simple decompressor along with a detailed explanation of how it works, so that with the only help of the lzip manual it would be possible for a digital archaeologist to extract the data from a lzip file long after quantum computers eventually render LZMA obsolete.
* Additionally the lzip reference implementation is copylefted, which guarantees that it will remain free forever.</description>
